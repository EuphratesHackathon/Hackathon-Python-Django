## Project Overview

This repository contains our security-enhanced version of PyGoat, an intentionally vulnerable Python-Django web application. Our team has addressed multiple critical security vulnerabilities and implemented industry-standard DevOps practices.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Python 3.11+
- Kubernetes 1.25+ (for deployment)

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FaveeDD/GroupzDevverse.git
   cd GroupzDevverse
   ```

2. Create environment file:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env with your secure values
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Main app: http://localhost:80
   - Insecure Deserialization Lab: http://localhost/insec_des_lab/
   - Sensitive Data Exposure Lab: http://localhost/sensitive_data_lab/

### Production Deployment

1. Deploy to Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

2. Monitor the deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n pygoat
   ```

## Compliance Checklist

### Security Fixes Implemented
- ✅ SQL Injection prevention through parameterized queries
- ✅ XSS mitigation with proper output encoding
- ✅ Broken authentication fixed with rate limiting
- ✅ Sensitive data exposure eliminated
- ✅ XML External Entities (XXE) vulnerabilities patched
- ✅ Security misconfiguration addressed
- ✅ Components with known vulnerabilities updated

### DevOps Enhancements
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal attack surface
- ✅ Non-root container execution
- ✅ Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- ✅ Secrets management with environment variables
- ✅ Resource constraints and health checks
- ✅ Centralized logging and monitoring
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployment capability

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions workflow includes:
1. Security scanning (Dependency Check, Bandit, Trivy)
2. Code quality checks (flake8, black, isort)
3. Automated testing
4. Docker image building and pushing
5. Kubernetes deployment

## Monitoring and Logging

- Structured JSON logging
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Alert configuration for critical events

## Known Limitations

1. Test coverage needs expansion for comprehensive validation
2. Advanced auto-scaling not implemented within time constraints
3. Service mesh integration pending for enhanced security
4. Some static analysis tools may report false positives due to intentional vulnerabilities

## Security Improvements Summary

1. **Container Security**: All applications run as non-root users with minimal privileges
2. **Network Security**: Proper network segmentation and security headers
3. **Data Protection**: Encrypted sensitive data at rest and in transit
4. **Access Control**: Role-based access control implemented
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and real-time alerting
